# Next.js Project with Zustand and TypeScript

This repository houses a Next.js project that leverages Zustand for state management and is built using TypeScript. The project primarily serves as a learning exercise, aiming to expand skills in state management and data fetching.

## Project Overview

While this project might not showcase impeccable design or perfect coding practices, it serves a crucial purpose: a sandbox for experimenting, learning, and growing as a developer. The project specifically emphasizes gaining proficiency in state management and efficient data fetching within a Next.js application.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Design**: The design of this project could be significantly enhanced. The focus so far has been on functionality and learning rather than aesthetics.
- **Loading State**: A loading state is noticeably absent. This is a known area for improvement and should be implemented to enhance the user experience during data fetching.

- **Code Quality**: Acknowledging that the code could be improved in terms of structure, readability, and efficiency, this project remains a work-in-progress. Future iterations will address these aspects.

## Getting Started

Feel free to clone this repository and utilize the code in any way you see fit. Whether it's for learning, experimentation, or even incorporating into your own projects, the code is here for you to build upon and adapt to your needs.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- Familiarity with React, Next.js, Zustand, and TypeScript

### API Endpoint

This project uses data from the [gogoanime-api](https://github.com/Tagliatelletbh/gogoanime-api). To configure the API URL, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and set the API URL:

### Cloning repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Tagliatelletbh/animio.git
```

then you can start the project with the following command

```
npm run dev
```

the server will be running with port 3000
